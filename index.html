    <!-- Tbh, I'm okay with this tab not being as persistent about age restriction.  Theoretically, someone under any specific age could still write things for submission "the boy was so cute and you kiss his cheek" and only access their specific post information (our version of upvotes--no down votes, maybe seen by #, etc) without accessing the whole site.  Like, if for some reason this site were to face scrutiny for educating the youth, "groomerism", or any other nonspecific grand attack on this site's integrity, fostering an "anonymous"--but ip-address recognizing--true story submission culture that could be accessed by kids, might help those really interested in identifying sexual predators, and to inform a public about patterns of abusive behaviors, and effective deescalation techniques used by empowered and emboldened victims or them around them, etc.-->  
    <!--I do not want to push the collapsible bar open tho without an event listener onclick or css transition.  This shouldn't shrink and scroll along in the same way as the logo, but once it's made, I'd love to implement it both in The Tales and in Survivor Stories-->

    <h3>Tiny Titty</h3>
    <p> 
        A southern, femme-forward library of anonymously submitted stories/memoirs centered around queer and atypical sex, kink, sex-positivity, harm-reduction, safer sex practices, and ethical, healthy sex work. Tiny Titty was created by a trans/gender-nonconforming womxn who, at the very least, spent MANY hours of their life on online hookup/dating sites, but who also survived rape and sexual assault. In creating a platform for titillating tales, this site sets out to give perspective to those new to the subject of sexuality and to give open and honest voice to often-forgotten or under-served communities.  Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Women, Trans, Twinks, Kinksters, Pups, Ponies, Fats, and Femmes to the front. The stories themselves are supposed to be informal and fun while also *intentionally* tiny.  Share a fun, quick memory of your life painted by sexuality or sexual tension.  Discover yourself in your own writing.  Hopefully, like all good titties, these stories are more than just something pretty to look at or show off, but part of a larger body of work--namely the whole collection.  Further, fostering a community of openness and honesty might lead to others sharing Titty Tales or Survivor Stories of their own.

        Survivor Stories is designed as space for those who have experienced trauma, arising out of what may've begun as a sexual experience, to tell their stories.  Abortion, difficult childbirth, sexual assault, spousal rape, domestic abuses--topics not quite in-step with Tiny Titty Tales--need to be heard. Decidedly not sex, these traumas still paint the day-to-day lives of the individuals who experienced them. If you survived, you should feel empowered and comfortable sharing your story with your community as any insight that allowed you to overcome your experience might very easily help someone else when faced with those same stakes in the future. Your voice is heard, valid, and valuable.  Your experience does not have to just color your life like a dark cloud, but can be the catalyst for someone else's survival.  Never forget how valuable your perspective can be.

        Titty Tales as a broad project follows in the established intersection of southern, feminist, and queer storytelling traditions.  We’re here, we’re queer, we’ve made decisions and lived lives, and we share these stories so that anyone reading can do the same and thrive. All sexes, gender identities, races, religious and sexual orientations welcome. No fascism nor hate tolerated—your philosophy may be up for debate, but human existence and human experience are not.
