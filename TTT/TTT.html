            <!-- I would like to scale this element when you reach a certain point in the page, but according to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/scale#accessibility_concerns I need to allow users to turn this function off site-wide as it can cause migraines -->
            <!-- once it shrinks, I want it to sticky to top, I also want it to have functionality to refresh the page. Whether it stays as some  navbar--which might be fine since the opacity of the nav and the sections match--can just depend on what looks best stylistically -->

        <!-- uses mxBig as the file back image.  There local rape crisis center "Ampersand" and "AVOL" have already been spoken to in the last year as well as the "Faulkner-Morgan Archive."  Local health department resources  and housing for the housing insecure are other very important things that could be alluded to.  -->
